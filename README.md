## Description
Yum is a recipe app where you can search for recipes, add recipes to your recipe box, and automatically add the recipe ingredients to your shopping list with the aisles the recipes can be found in. Once you have tried the recipe, you can review the recipe and post pictures of what you made. 

### Background
My wife loves to cook and often creates shopping lists based on recipes, so I thought to create this app as a tribute to her.

## Getting Started
Click the link [here](https://yumm-yum.herokuapp.com/) and sign up for an account. Once you have signed up, you can search for recipes and interact with the website as you please

> Warning: The API used has a limit on how many call you can make to it per day. It is possible (though unlikely) that this limit has been hit on that day, and as such the search functionality will not work as intended. A different API is in the works, but cost constraints limit my choices.

### Next Steps
- Better search functionality implemented (dependent on the upcoming decision on a new API)
